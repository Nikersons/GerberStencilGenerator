Simple and intuitive Gerber RS-274X editor for easily creating PCB Stencils

Introduction

As a Hobbyist n the DIY-/Maker Community designing small PCBs I usually order my PCBs from a Manufacturer together with a accompanying Solder Past Stencil for SMD Components Soldering.

Some more advanced Editors have special Functions to generate a custom Stencil Gerber File, but many will only leave you with the sole Option to export the Solder Paste Layer and use it as the Stencil File "as is". 
Often that will work just fine, but sometimes having the ability to customize the File a bit more would come in quite handy.

Some Manufacturers allow size-adjustments or corner-modifications of the Stencil Shapes - however, mostly with one setting to be applied to all Shapes equally.

If you are like me, you just want that little extra flexibility of adjusting each group of Shapes individually. This lead to the development of this very Program.

As a final note let me clearly say, that it is far from being perfect or even completed - it is a Work-In-Progress with a lot left to do, but it is a start at least.
